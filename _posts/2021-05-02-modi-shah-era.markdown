16 May 2014 will forever be etched in the history of modern India. This marked the beginning of the Modi-Shah era of Indian politics. In the backdrop of 10 years of UPA rule, marred by numerous corruption scandals and nepotism allegations, for a young, hopeful, politically-unaware me this was supposed to be the time when India would graduate from politics of caste, religion and regionalism to politics of development and growth. This was supposed to be the shift that would finally unveil India as the next-big-superpower.

Unforunately what transpired was nothing close to what I had hoped for. In this blog I will try to present the most important developments during this period based on what what I think India represents. Given the relentless pursuit of the regime to control the narrative **at all costs**, I believe the documentation of an alternate viewpoint is valuable.

I have no political affiliations and no intention of promoting one party over another. I feel all political parties do whats best for them with little regard for the common good. Having said that there are certain aspects that should never be played around with. These aspects are what define India or are prime in terms of governing India's trajectory. What these aspects are may vary between individuals but I believe the core should largely remain unchanged. These opinions are my own and may not align 100% with anyone else's.

# The Modi-Shah Era (2014-present)

## Subversion of Democratic Instutions
In my opinion one of the most damaging effects of the Modi-Shah era has been the subversion of important democratic institutions of the country. I believe the effects of this will be felt for a very long time to come especially given the abysmal state of the opposition especially on the national level.

### Judiciary
The judiciary is one of the three main pillars of the Indian democracy. Given the largest party/coalition forms the crucial part of the executive (namely Prime Minister and the Cabinet), both the legislature and the executive are controlled by the same set of people. This supremely enhances the role of the Judiciary as an institution to check against the excesses of legislature and the exectuive. While the legislature ( and the exectuive ) derive their legitimacy from the electoral process the Judiciary derives its legitimacy from open, transparent and logical decision-making.

Unfortunately during this period, the Judiciary, especially the Supreme court has transformed into an extension of the executive as reflected in the arbitrary, secretive decision making, judicial evasion to favour the executive, making a mockery of 'habeus corpus' etc. This iis best reflected in the attitude of the CJI and their exercise of power as the Master of the Roster.

No doubt the blame for failing the people of the country should and will be borne by the Judiciary but what is important to note is who created the fertile grounds for this colossal failure. Attributing the complete blame for the failure of the judiciary on the judges would be analogous to convicting the hitman while letting the mastermind go scot free. Trying to fix the issue at the level of judges would be like treating the symptoms and not the root cause of a disease. One might try to argue agagainst this idea by quoting the example of Justice Khanna during the 1976 Emergency. Such individuals are rare. To expect men of such resolve to occupy position of authority and persist in the face of extreme onslaught would be too optimistic and naive. More often than not, these crucial positions are occupied by ordinary human beings that are meant to function ordinarily under ordinary circumtances. Unfortunately, under extraordinary scenarios, they crumble under pressure. While their lack of fight is something to be condemned, the forces behind such extraordinary circustances are the prime cluprit for the failure of the system.
