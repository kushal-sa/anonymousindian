16 May 2014 will forever be etched in the history of modern India. This marked the beginning of the Modi-Shah era of Indian politics. In the backdrop of 10 years of UPA rule, marred by numerous corruption scandals and nepotism allegations, for a young, hopeful, politically-unaware me this was supposed to be the time when India would graduate from politics of caste, religion and regionalism to politics of development and growth. This was supposed to be the shift that would finally unveil India as the next-big-superpower.

Unforunately what transpired was nothing close to what I had hoped for. In this blog I will try to present the most important developments during this period based on what what I think India represents. Given the relentless pursuit of the regime to control the narrative **at all costs**, I believe the documentation of an alternate viewpoint is valuable.

I have no political affiliations and no intention of promoting one party over another. I feel all political parties do whats best for them with little regard for the common good. Having said that there are certain aspects that should never be played around with. These aspects are what define India or are prime in terms of governing India's trajectory. What these aspects are may vary between individuals but I believe the core should largely remain unchanged. These opinions are my own and may not align 100% with anyone else's.
